# Light Review of Existing Diffs

Quick review of current git changes for obvious issues.

1. Run `git diff` (or `git diff --staged`) to see changes.
2. Flag only high-severity issues: logic errors, security risks, scope violations, broken error handling.
3. Keep feedback brief (1–2 sentences per issue).
4. Skip style nitpicks unless they contradict project rules.
