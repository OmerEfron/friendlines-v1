# Write Tests

1. Identify the target module, component, or API endpoint.
2. Create tests following project conventions (e.g. `*.test.js` or `*.spec.js` in appropriate locations).
3. Cover:
   - Happy path
   - Key edge cases and errors
   - For API: request validation, error responses
   - For components: rendering, user interactions
4. Use the project's test runner and assertion library.
5. Keep tests focused; avoid redundant or overlapping coverage.
