# FriendLines Product Guardrails

## Identity
FriendLines is a **personal news network**—not social media, a journaling app, a chatbot, or a therapy tool.
The user is the subject; an AI journalist reports their life in structured news coverage (Ynet-style tone).

## V1 Scope (Enforce Strictly)
- **In:** Single user, single AI journalist, Telegram intake, minimal web edition, daily publications, weekly interviews, archive.
- **Out:** Social/sharing, circles, multi-user, WhatsApp/calendar integrations, advanced analytics, notification systems (except Telegram).

## Editorial Constraints
- **Tone:** Structured, professional, impactful. No exaggeration, clickbait, therapy, or forced humor.
- **Tiers:** Tier 1 (600–900 words), Tier 2 (300–500 words), Tier 3 (80–180 words). Not every conversation yields a story.
- **Articles:** Must include framing, continuity, context, and perspective—honest coverage without unnecessary drama.

## Architecture Guardrails
- Flow: Telegram → Express backend → PostgreSQL → React frontend.
- Backend modules: Conversation Engine, Thread Manager, Editorial Analyzer, Article Generator, Edition Builder.
- Frontend routes: `/`, `/archive`, `/article/:id`. No SSR for V1.
