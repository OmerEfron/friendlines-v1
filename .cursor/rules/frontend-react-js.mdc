# Frontend React (JavaScript)

## Components & Hooks
- Use functional components only.
- Hooks at top level only—no conditionals, loops, or nested functions.
- Separate distinct sync processes into individual `useEffect` hooks.
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks (e.g. data-fetching, route state).

## Routes
- `/` (Today's edition)
- `/archive` (chronological list)
- `/article/:id` (single article)
- Use React Router or equivalent; no SSR for V1.

## Data Flow
- Fetch edition/articles via backend API.
- Keep state local to route or page; avoid global state unless necessary.
