# Git Operations

## Commits
- Write clear commit messages: imperative mood, concise subject.
- Conventional format: `type(scope): subject` (e.g. `feat(api): add edition list endpoint`, `fix(telegram): cap clarifying questions at 3`).
- Commit in meaningful chunks; avoid mixed-feature or unrelated changes in one commit.

## Safety
- Do not `git push --force` or rewrite history unless the user explicitly requests it.
- Do not `git push` without explicit user request; prefer staging and committing locally first.
- Before destructive operations (reset, rebase, force push), confirm with the user.

## Branching
- Use descriptive branch names (e.g. `feat/article-archive`, `fix/webhook-timeout`).
- Keep commits focused; one logical change per commit when feasible.
